# Test case : Kalman filter for accelerometer.  
## Description:  
To improve quality value from sensor.  
uses a set of equations and consecutive data inputs to quickly estimate the true value  

##  Test procedure:  
Read sensor value to estimate value  

## Test Data:  
we will flip the board and read data from yaw axis  

## Expected results:  
Landscape 	~1000  
Flip left 	0 	to 	100  
Flip right	0	to 	100
